## Distributed System

1. Distributed systems:

   - a number of computers or computing nodes that are linked by a network and that share data, processing or both (Dewire 1994)
   - A distributed system is a collection of **autonomous** hosts that are connected through a computer network.
   - Each host executes components and operates adistribution **middleware**.
   - Middleware **enables** the components to **coordinate** their activities.
   - Users perceive the system as a **single**, **integrated** computing facility

2. Common Characteristics:

   - Resource sharing: Data, Hardware
   - Performance: Latency and Throughput
   - Openness and heterogeneity: applications and data may be difficult to relocate and reconfigure
   - Concurrency: operate concurrently using shared information objects without interference
   - Scalability: can solve larger problems without large computers
   - Fault-tolerance: redundant processing agents for system availability
   - Transparency
   - Reliability

3. Distributed and Concurrent Systems:

   - Distributed and concurrent systems both deal with "<u>*multiple things happening together*</u>"
     - Distributed systems deal with multiple execution threads on **more than one** computer
     - Concurrent systems deal with multiple execution threads on **a single computer**
   - They share some common aspects
     - need to **communicate**
     - **sharing of state**
   - They differ in the **amount** of shared information and in **communication bandwidth**
   - These produce different programming concerns
   - A common way of <u>dealing with some of the problems caused by distributed systems</u> on a local basis is to <u>use concurrency techniques</u>

4. Centralized vs Distributed Systems:

   - Centralized Systems
     - Centralized systems have **non-autonomous components**
     - Centralized systems are **often** build using **homogeneous** technology
     - Multiple users <u>share the resources of a centralized system at **all times**</u>
     - Centralized systems have <u>**a single point of** control and of failure</u>
   - Distributed Systems
     - Distributed systems have **autonomous components**
     - Distributed systems **may be** built using **heterogeneous** technology
     - Distributed system components **may** be used **exclusively**
     - Distributed systems are executed **in concurrent processes**
     - Distributed systems have **multiple points of failure**

5. Dimensions of transparency in DS

   - Access Transparency
   - Location Transparency
   - Migration Transparency
   - Replication Transparency 
   - Concurrency Transparency
   - Scalability Transparency
   - PerformanceTransparency
   - Failure Transparency

6. Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributed Systems

   - Advantages
     - Shareability
     - Expandability
     - Local autonomy
     - Improved performance
     - Improved reliability and availability
     - Potential cost reductions
   - Disadvantages
     - Network reliance
     - Complexities
     - Security
     - Multiple point of failure

7. Threads:

   - Threads are "lightweight processes". They share more information than heavyweight processes.
   - Typically threads share:
     - the same system stack
     - the same heap memory
   - Threads usually have their own procedure call/local variable stacks.

8. Java Threads:

   - Java includes threads as part of the language model
   - No extra libraries are required
   - An application consists of at least one "user" thread which runs the `main()` method
   - The main thread may create and run other threads as well
   - A JVM may run several "kernel" and "user"threads as well
   - An application terminates when **all user threads** terminate

9. Thread Creation: 

   - method 1:

     ```
     // Subclass from Thread:

     class MyThread extends Thread { 
     	public void run() {
     	// code for my thread declared here
     	} 
     }

     //Start this thread by:
     MyThread thr = new MyThread(); 
     thr.start(); //calls the run() method
     ```

   - method 2:

     ```
     // Implement Runnable:
     class MyRun implements Runnable { 
     	public void run() {
     	// code for my thread
     	}
     }

     // Start this thread by:
     MyRun runner = new MyRun(); 
     new Thread(runner).start();
     ```

## Architecture and TCP/IP

1. What is computer network architecture?

   - “the design of a computer network.”
   - “the blueprint that provides a framework and technology foundation for designing, building and managing a communication network.”
   - “The communication equipment, protocols and transmission links that constitute a network, and the methods by which they are arranged.”
   - “the infrastructure, functionality, protocols, and standards implemented in a particular network design.”

2. Protocol and Protocol Layers:

   - Communications <u>betweens processes</u> takes place using agreed conventions — protocols
   - Network communications requires protocols to <u>cover high-level application communication all the way down to wire communication</u>
   - Complexity handled by encapsulation in protocol layers

3. Connection Models:

   - **Connection oriented** 
     - A single connection is established for the session
     - Two-way communications flow along the connection
     - When the session is over, the connection is broken
     - The analogy is to a phone conversation
     - An example is <u>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</u>
   - **Connectionless**
     - In a connectionless system, messages are sent independent of each other
     - Ordinary mail is the analogy
     - Connectionless messages may arrive out of order
     - An example is the <u>Internet Protocol ( IP )</u>
     - <u>Connection oriented transports may be established on top of connectionless ones: TCP over IP</u>
     - <u>Connectionless transports my be established on top of connection oriented ones: HTTP over TCP</u>

4. Distributed Computing Models:

   - Peer to Peer

     ![p2p](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fgbezlc48ij30bg046t8q.jpg)

   - Filter

     ![filter](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fgbeznbup1j30d603maa5.jpg)

   - Client Server

     ![c:s](https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fgbezjwoa2j30bu046dfv.jpg)

5. Client/Server System:

   ![css](https://ws2.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fgbi5cern9j30x40i4764.jpg)

6. Server Distribution:

   - Single client, single server
   - Multiple clients, single server
   - Single client, multiple servers
   - Multiple clients, multiple servers

7. Three Tier Models:

   ![3tiermod](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fgbi5hbcdkj31120jggpb.jpg)

8. TCP/IP:

   - The OSI model was **devised using a committee process wherein the standard was set up and then implemented**.
   - Some parts of the OSI standard are <u>obscure</u>,some parts <u>cannot</u> <u>easily</u> be <u>implemented</u>, some parts have not been implemented.
   - The TCP/IP protocol was <u>devised through a long-running DARPA project. This worked by implementation followed by RFCs</u>.
   - TCP/IP is the principal Unix networking protocol. TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.

9. UDP and TCP:

   - **UDP** is also <u>connectionless</u> and <u>unreliable</u>. What it adds to IP is <u>*a checksum for the contents*</u> of the <u>datagram</u> and <u>port numbers</u>. These are used to give a client/server model.
   - TCP <u>supplies logic to give a reliable connection-oriented protocol above IP</u>. It provides a virtual circuit that two processes can use to communicate.

10. Middleware:

  - Software that is logically placed between the **higher level layer** consisting of <u>users and applications</u> and **layer underneath** consisting of <u>other services and the o/s</u>.
  - Components:
    - The **network services** include things likeTCP/IP
    - The middleware layer is **application-independent software** using the network services
  - Functions:
    - **Initiation** of processes at different computers
    - Session **management**
    - **Directory** services to allow clients to locate servers
    - Remote data **access**
    - **Concurrency control** to allow servers to handle multiple clients
    - **Security** and **integrity**
    - **Monitoring**
    - **Termination** of processes both local and remote

11. Internet Addresses:

    - To use a service you must be able to find it.
    - The Internet uses an address scheme for machines so that they can be located.
    - The address is a 32 bit integer which gives the IP address for IPv4.(IPv6 is 128 bit)
    - This encodes a network ID and more addressing.
    - The network ID falls into various classes according to the size of the network address.
    - The Java class `InetAddress` can be used to get/manipulate internet addresses. Methods include:
    - `static InetAddress getByName(String host)`
    - `static InetAddress getLocalHost()`
    - `String getHostAddress(); // in dotted form`
    - `String getHostName();`

12. Ports and Sockets:

    - A **port** is <u>*logical*</u> connection. It is an abstraction in the computer's memory it is <u>*NOT a physical entity*</u>.
    - A **socket** is a connection for communication between two machines.
    - A **service** exists on a host, and is **identified by its port**.
    - The Socket and ServerSocket are the Java client and server classes to do this.
    - A server uses a ServerSocket to bind to a port and listen on it. When a new client request is accepted, it returns a Socket which is connected to the client. The server uses this to talk to the client, typically reading requests and responding to them
    - When you know how to reach a service via itsnetwork and port IDs, what then?
      - If you are a client you need an API that will allow you to send messages to that service and read replies from it.
      - If you are a server, you need to be able to create aport and listen at it. When a message comes in you need to be able to read and write to it.
    - The ClientSocket and ServerSocket are the Java client and server classes to do this










## Protocol Design

1. Protocol design:
   - A client and server need to **exchange information via messages**.
   - TCP and UDP provide the transport mechanisms to do this.
   - The two processes also have to have a protocol in place so that message exchange can take place meaningfully.
   - Broadcast vs. Point-to-point.
     - Broadcast must be UDP
     - Point to point could be either TCP or UDP
   - State vs. Stateless
     - Is it reasonable for one side to maintain state about the other side?
     - It is often simpler to do so, but what happens if something crashes?
   - Reliable vs. Unreliable
2. Version Control:
   - A protocol used in a client/server system will <u>**evolve** over time,changing as the system expands</u>.
   - This raises compatibility problems:
     - A version 2 client will make requests that a version 1 server doesn't understand
     - Where as a version 2 server will send replies that a version 1client won't understand.
   - Each side should ideally <u>be able to understand messages for its own version and all earlier ones</u>.
     - It should be able to write replies to old style queries in old style response format.
   - The ability to talk earlier version formats may be lost if the protocol changes too much
   - In this case, you need to be able to ensure that no copies of the earlier version still exist
   - Part of the protocol setup should involve version information
3. JNLP/Webstart:
   - JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol) is one attempt to **overcome version problems for client-side applications**.
   - A fixed browser-side helper will manage all documents of type JNLP (ending in .jnlp).
   - A document of this type contains <u>version information of the Java classes used by a Java application</u>.
   - **If there are local copies of these classes which are up-to-date, then these are used to start the application**.
   - **If the local classes are not up-to-date, new copies are downloaded from an HTTP server**.
   - Instead of starting an application, you <u>*request a JNLP document representing the application*</u>
4. Data Serialisation:
   - Messages are sent across the network as <u>a sequence of bytes</u>, which has no structure except for a linear stream of bytes.
5. Message & Data Format:
   - Usually, the **first part** of the message will be **a message type**.
   - The first part of the message is typically <u>a byte to distinguish between message types.</u>
   - The message handler would examine this first byte to distinguish message type and <u>then perform a switch to select the appropriate handler for that type</u>.
   - **Further bytes** in the message would **contain message content** according to <u>a predrefined format.</u>
   - The advantages are **compactness** and **hence speed**.









## State, HOPP and Structure

1. State:

   - Applications often make use of state information to simplify what is going on. For example:
     - Keeping file pointers to current file location
     - Keeping current mouse position
     - Keeping current customer value.
   - In a distributed system, such state information <u>may be kept</u> in the **client**, in the **server**, or in **both**.
   - The important point is to **whether one process is keeping state information about <u>*itself*</u> or about the *<u>other process</u>***.
   - One process may keep as much state information about itself as it wants, <u>without causing any problems</u>.
   - If it needs to keep information about the state of the other process, then problems arise:
     - The process' actual knowledge of the state of the other may become incorrect.
     - This can be caused by loss of messages (in UDP), by failure to update, or by software errors.
   - Issues
     - *<u>If the server maintains information about the client, then it must be able to recover if the client crashes.</u>*
     - *<u>If information is not saved, then on each transaction the client must transfer sufficient information for the server to function.</u>*
     - *<u>If the connection is unreliable, then additional handling must be in place to ensure that the two do not get out of synch.</u>*

2. HOPP (Half Object Plus Protocol)

   - HOPP brings the change to a client/server system, the FTP object is split in two:

     - <u>*one half in the client address space*</u>
     - <u>*the other half in the server address space</u>*

   - The two half-objects will communicate using **a private protocol** that is **unknown** to the rest of the application.

   - The private protocol will here be "message passing using sockets".

   - Other implementations may use CORBA, RMI, JXTA, etc.

   - This allows the implementation of the HOPP objects to <u>be changed without affecting the rest of the application</u>

   - If the protocol changes, you **only need to change the client HOPP** and the server. The rest should remain essentially unaltered.

     ![hipppp](https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fgbi5esk4vj30ye0h0acz.jpg)

3. Mutual Agreement:

   - If the server decides to send e.g. an int, a byte and a null terminated string, then **the client must be able to read them in this form**.
   - Mutual agreement means that the client and the server must hav**e agreed beforehand on the format of the messages**.
   - **No information about the format is exchanged**, because both client and server know what to expect.
   - This method is **commonly used**. e.g. by most Remote Procedure Call protocols. There is no overhead of redundant information. **Only the necessary data is sent**.
   - Mutual agreement is **not type-safe**. If the server sends an int instead of a byte, then the client will just get the wrong data. It may even crash.
   - Safer messages include **some sort of type information as part of the message**





## Security and Java

1. Security:

   - Security of the organisation affects 100%programs you write
   - Many more opportunities for securityproblems in client/server applications
     - Unauthorised access
     - Disclosure of information
     - Modification of information
     - Denial of service

2. Orange Book:

   - Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) is a US Government Department of Defence (DoD) standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of computer system security.
   - The TCSEC is used to **evaluate**, **classify** and **select** computer systems
   - Being considered for the **processing**, **storage** and **retrieval** of sensitive or classified information.
   - D - minimal
   - C1 - discretionary access control
   - C2 - controlled access protection
   - B1 - labelled security protection
   - B2 - structured protection
   - B3 - security domains
   - A1 - verified design

3. ISO Securty and Firewalls:

   - ISO Security
     - Security Attacks, Mechanisms & Services (Slide 9-12, Week 5)
       - Peer entity authentication
       - Data origin authentication
       - Access control service

       - Non-repudiation at origin
       - Non-repudiation of receipt
     - Security Policies (Slide 13, Week 5)
       - Anything **not explicitly permitted** is **prohibited**
       - Anything **not explicitly prohibited** is **permitted**
     - Security Functions Needed (Slide 14, Week 5)
       - Identification
       - Authentication - proof of identity
       - Authorisation - privileges belonging to identity
       - Integrity-dataisnottamperedwith
       - Confidentiality - data is not exposed to others
       - Delegation and administration
       - Recording
       - Monitoring
     - Security Location
       - Host security
         - Authentication (e.g. passwords) 
         - Authorisation (e.g. access files)
         - Physical access
       - Network security
         - Isolate network
         - Protect behind firewalls
         - Use proxy servers
   - Firewalls
     - A firewall is a router that controls access as well as routes
     - Some packets are passed, some are discarded
     - The firewall controls all access between the network and internet
     - A "filter" uses rules to decide what passes and what doesn't 

4. Lessons for Client/Server:

   - Verify IP origin
   - Use logging
   - Care with user configurable files
   - Care with passwords
   - Use handshaking
   - Keep security layer simple
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Design protocol to allow security checks
   - Ensure your protocol is allowed by security manager if crossing firewalls
   - More likely to find UDP blocked than TCP

5. Encryption:

   - **Secret Key**
     - Both encryption and decryption use same key
     - Key must be kept secret from others
     - Key must be known by at least two people
   - **Public Key**
     - 2 keys needed, one to encrypt one to decrypt
     - Both keys generated at the same time
     - Both keys needed
     - One key can't easily be derived from the other
   - **Digital Signature**
     - B wants to send a message to A
     - A wants to verify it came un-tampered from B
     - B encrypts message using B's private key
     - A decrypts it using B's public key
     - If A gets garbage
       - message didn't come from B; or
       - message was changed in transit
     - Signature may be detached from text, and sent separately as well!

   - Secure Sockets Layer (Slide 63-65, Week 5)









## HTTP and Java

1. HTTP — Design:
   - HTTP is a <u>stateless</u>, <u>connectionless</u>, and <u>reliable</u> protocol.
   - Each request from a client is <u>handled reliably and then the connection is broken</u>.
   - The web is an excellent example of a set of protocols stretched way beyond the iroriginal scope, with a huge series of patches at all levels to try to fix problems.
2. HTTP — Versions
   - There are 3 versions of HTTP
     - Version 0.9 - <u>totally obsolete</u>
     - Version 1.0 - <u>almost obsolete</u> 
     - Version 1.1 - <u>current</u>
     - Version 2.0 - <u>recent</u>
   - Each version must understand all earlierversions
3. POST versus GET:
   - "Normal" queries use GET.
   - Strictly, if a request is "**idempotent**" it should use GET.
   - Idempotent means that **the client is not asking for a state change in the server, and would expect a repeat request to return the same result**.
   - This is the norm for static document requests
     - GET http://localhost/index.html
4. Server-side Processing — Servlets:
   - Java servlets run **as modules within an HTTP server**
   - Servlets run **as threads within a continuous Java process**
   - The **startup costs for a thread** are **lower** than the startup costs for a **process**
   - Servlets are **faster** than the corresponding CGI script
   - Servlets **have a standard API for accessing cookies**, etc.
   - Servlets also **have session management**
   - Session **Tracking** and **Cookies** to **overcome the stateless nature of HTTP**









## RPC and RMI

1. Remote Procedure Call:

   - **Ordinary Procedure Call**

     - The imperative languages use the procedure <u>as a means of structuring the language.</u>
     - The language will <u>have conditionals, loops and procedure calls.</u>
     - When a procedure is called, it usually **makes use of the stack**, **pushing parameters onto the stack** and **reserving space for local variables**

   - **Remote Procedure Call**

   - - The socket method of network use is a message-based system, in which one process writes a message to another.

     - This is a long way from the procedural model, or the method call of O/O.

     - The remote procedure call is **intended to act like a procedure call, but to act**

       **across the network transparently.**

     - The process makes a remote procedure call by **pushing its parameters and a return address onto the stack**, and **jumping to the start of the procedure**.The procedure itself is responsible for accessing and using the network.

     - **After the remote execution is over, the procedure jumps back to the return address**. The calling process then **continues**.

2. Relation to HOPP:

   - The network needs to be made invisible, so that everything looks just like ordinary procedure calls.
   - RPC is a procedural example of HOPP
   - Client procedures are like the methods of a clientHOPP.
   - The client-side implementation establishes a socket connection, sends parameters and reads results.
   - The server procedures are like the methods of theserver HOPP.
   - The server-side implementation is called by a server and contains the real implementation of the procedure.

3. Components of RPC:

   - An RPC system consists of the following pieces
     - A set of data types that can be sent as parameters and receivedas results
     - A representation of these data types
     - A message format for sending procedure name and parametersand getting procedure reply
   - A means of representing the procedures and their signatures (parameters and result types) in a form independent of implementation - this will be used to generate two implementations, one on the client side, the other on the server. This acts as a specification of a remote procedure call
   - A mechanism for automatically generating a client stub
   - A mechanism for automatically generating a server stub
   - A way of linking the server-side implementation of the procedure tothe server stub so that the stub can call it

4. RMI:

   - RMI is a cross **between remote procedure call and mobile objects**
   - A server-side object is created, along with a stub object
   - **Both the server-side object and the stub implement a"well known" interface**
   - The server-side object remains on the server, and receivesand executes remote method calls
   - **The stub is moved as a mobile object to a client**
   - The client makes calls on the stub which makes remote calls on the server-side object

5. RMI Requirements on Interfaces:

   - To use RMI, you start with an interface that both client and server will know about
   - This interface must also satisfy some requirements for RMI
     - The interface must **extend the** `Remote` **interface**
     - **Every method must be declared to throw a** `RemoteException`
   - An implementation must implement the "wellknown" remote interface

6. Remote Object Server

   {0}. Every remote object must have a server
   {0}. The role of the server is:
      {0}. create the object
      {0}. export it to the RMI runtime system
      {0}. make it publicly visible in some way
      {0}. stay alive to respond to calls on the object - this is done automatically by the RMI runtime because it spawns another thread during construction
      {0}. Let the client know where the class files are stored. This is done by setting the property `java.rmi.server.codebase` to a URL

7. Advertising and Finding Objects:

   {0}. Advertising Objects:

      {0}. The "client component" of a service must "locate" the service in some way; once it has found, it can make calls on the client
      {0}. One way that can be found is by using the **RMI registry**
      {0}. This is a simple database of remote objects that build’s up
      {0}. One registry must run on each machine that isexporting/update the database

   {0}. Finding Objects:

      {0}. Objects are found using the **RMI registry** as follows:

         ```
         Hello greeting = (Hello)Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost/Hello");
         ```








## CORBA and EJBs

1. CORBA:

   - Remote Procedure Call uses a specification to generate the client-side half-object and the server
   - RPC generates <u>procedure calls</u>, **not method calls**
   - RMI is **Java-to-Java only**.
   - The main <u>extension of RPC to use object methods instead of procedure calls</u> is CORBA
   - The Common Object Request Broker Architecture is **a middleware system for building distributed applications**. It is looked after by the Object Management Group (OMG) which has been in existence since 1991.
   - CORBA supports distributed objects. The "objects" may be written inC, C++, Ada, Java, SmallTalk, Python, etc. Some of these are not O/O languages. A single distributed application may use a mixture of languages.
   - Objects communicate by **making method calls on one another**. TheCORBA "backplane" or Object Request Broker (ORB) looks after marshalling parameters, transferring the data, making the remote call and returning the results.

2. Finding Objects:

   - Objects may be located in a variety of ways. These include:

     - Portable "string-ified" references
     - Naming service
     - Trader service

   - A naming service is a **process** <u>running independently of any other clients and servers</u>

   - A service will register itself with the naming service, passing both a simple string as its name and an object reference to itself.

   - A client will then ask the naming service for the service by using its name, and will get back an object reference.

   - The Naming Service is found this way in Java:

     ```
     org.omg.CORBA.Object obj;
     org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContext nameComp;
     obj = orb.resolve_initial_references("NameService");
     nameComp = org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContextHelper.narrow(obj);
     ```

3. CORBA IDL

   - To achieve language independence, CORBA applications are specified by interfaces written in an IDL (Interface Definition Language).

   - CORBA IDL is different to Sun's RPC/ONC IDL and to DCE IDL. It is based on C++, with changes toaccommodate distributed objects, such as in/out parameters instead of reference/value parameters

   - A simple IDL is

     ```
     module HelloApp {
       interface Hello {
         string getGreeting();
       };
     };
     ```

4. EJB (Enterprise Java Beans):

   - EJBs are s**erver side components** written in Java that **implement business logic**.
   - They are Java classes with certain annotations.
   - They can access databases, and be called/invoked by remote and local clients/components.

5. Benefits of EJBs:

   - EJBs **simplify the development of large distributed applications**.
     - First, because the **EJB container provides system-level services to enterprise beans**, the bean developer can concentrate on solving business problems.The EJB container is responsible for system-level services, such as transaction management and security authorization.
     - Second, because the beans rather than the clients contain the application’s business logic, **the client developer can focus on the presentation of the client**. The client developer does not have to code the routines that implement business rules or access databases. As a result, <u>the clients are thinner, a benefit that is particularly important for clients that run on small devices</u>.
     - Third, because enterprise beans are portable components, the **application assembler can build new applications from existing beans**. Provided they use the standard APIs, these apps can run on any compliant Java EE server.
     - Finally through the annotations certain type of EJB and **the container will perform many functions (e.g. managing transaction and security) on behalf of the EJB**.

6. Types of EJBs:

   - **Session Beans**: encapsulate business logic that can be invoked programmatically by a client over local, remote, or web service client views
     - Stateless Session Beans
     - Stateful Session Beans
     - Singleton Session Beans
   - **Message Driven Beans (MDBs)**: are used for integrating with external systems by receiving asynchronous messages using Java Messaging Service.







## Web Services

1. Web Service:

   - A web service is **a server application** that <u>can be invoked using the HTTP protocol by SOAP calls.</u>
   - Web services allow applications and agents to browse the Web on behalf of users
   - Instead of a user navigating HTML screens, an agent can connect to services on the Web and interact with them directly without the distraction of presentation elements
   - SOAP/WSDL/UDDI are the technologies behind Web services

2. Web Service Components:

   - WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is the metalanguage used to describe a Web service. It corresponds to the IDL (Interface Definition Language) of other RPC systems
   - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) corresponds to the XDR level of Sun's RPC
     - SOAP messages are either
       - a request for a service
       - a response from a service
   - UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) is the resource registration and lookup mechanism. It corresponds to the Naming Services of CORBA, RMI. Hardly anyone uses it - it is too hard and was notdesigned for Web Services anyway

3. Web Service Environmental Support:

   - Web services are basically **RPC across port 80**.
   - Web services require the following environmental support
     - **An HTTP server** configured to pass Web service requests to a CGI script / servlet / JSP / ASP /...
     - **A user agent** that is <u>not a browser to prepare Web method requests and understand responses</u>
     - The user agent may <u>**make use of a browser** for handling HTTP requests from the user side</u>
     - **Firewall** **access** to allow arbitrary content to pass on port 80 (could be exploited as a security hole!)

4. Web Services RPC:

5. REST standards:

   - While not standardized itself, REST relies on other standards:
     - HTTP as the network protocol
     - URI and URL for naming resources
     - XML, JSON, HTML, GIF, JPEG etc to represent resources 
   - JSR311 defines JAX-RS 1.1
     - Makes it easy to define RESTful web service in Java
     - Support for JavaBeans as resources

6. REST mechanism:

   - Server exposes **resources at URIs**
   - Client accesses and modifies resources using standard **HTTP verbs**:
     - GET retrieves a resource
     - PUT replaces or creates a resource
     - POST creates a new entry in acollection
     - DELETE deletes a resource
   - **Server** maintains **state of the resources**
   - **Client** maintains **session state**

7. REST, XML and JSON:

   - REST does not prescribe dataformat
   - Relies on **content negotiationas** defined for HTTP:
     - Client sends Accept or Content-type header
     - Server may produce/consume different formats for the same URI
   - Popular formats are XML andJSON
   - JSON is less verbose (moreefficient)

## Java Message Service and Multiple Middleware

1. Java Message Service Components:
   - **A JMS provider**: A messaging system that implements the JMS specification.
   - **JMS clients**: Java applications that send and receive messages.
   - **Messages**: Objects that are used to communicate information between JMS clients.
   - **Administered objects**: Preconfigured JMS objects that are created by an administrator for the use of JMS clients.
2. Message Delivery Models:
   - Point-to-Point (queue destination)
   - Publish-subscribe (topic destination)
   - Request-Reply Messaging
3. JMS Messages:
   - A JMS message contains header info, Properties & Body mostly set by JMS
   - The body of a message can be of different types:
     - A **TextMessage** has a text body
     - A **BytesMessage** has a byte array body
     - A **MapMessage** has a set of string/value pairs, etc.
   - A TextMessage has methods get/setText(), etc.
4. Locating the Queue:
   - The queue can be found, using a lookup system
   - The **Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)JNDI is used as lookup system**
   - Search for a lookup system by new `InitialContext()`
   - This will use properties such as `java.naming.factory.initial` which will need to beset to a suitable class for JNDI, System MessageQueue, etc
   - Deploying the app as a J2EE app should set thisproperty
5. Session State:
   - There are three possibilities for managingclient state on the server:
     - The server keeps **no state**
     - The server keeps **state on a per-client basis**
     - The session keeps **a single client state**
   - The Web Service follows (1,2 or 3) depending on scope
6. Session State:
   - The CORBA and RMI servers follow case (3): there is <u>a single server object</u> that **keeps one copy of server state**. If multiple clients do a “`chdir`” command then the value of the state changes for every client
   - The socket server creates a new service object for each client connection and so follows case (2). Each “`chdir`”is unique for each client connection
   - All of the middleware models agree only if the protocol has no state requirements.
   - We do not have any formal models to describe state models in the server







## Mobile Development

1. Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing:
   - Result from the development in device **miniaturization** and **wireless** connectivity
   - Mobile computing is concerned with exploiting the **connectedness** of devices that move around in the everyday physical world
   - **Ubiquitous** computing, also known as pervasive computing, is about <u>exploiting the increasing integration of computing devices with our everyday physical world</u>
   - Context-aware computing as a subfield, where <u>computersystems automatically adapt their behaviour according to physical circumstances</u>
2. Volatile Systems:
   - From the point of view of distributed systems, there is **no essential difference** between mobile and ubiquitous computing
   - Due to the ways of physical integration, volatility is a distributed systems property - certain changes are common rather than exceptional
   - The relevant forms of volatility include:
     - Failures of devices and communication links
     - Changes in the characteristics of communication such as bandwidth
     - The creation and destruction of *associations* - logical communication relationships - between software components resident on the devices
3. Mobiel Operating Systems:
   - As oppose to controlling a PC or a Mac, aMobile OS controls mobile devices
   - Popular mobile operation systems
     - evolving from previously Windows CE, Windows Mobile,Palm OS, Symbian to nowadays iOS, Android, BlackBerryOS, WebOS, Bada etc.
   - Programming languages
     - Java, C#, C++, Objective-C, JavaScript, Ruby, HTML etc.
