# Week 1

1. **Computer science**: the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. 
2. **Algorithm**: a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are solutions.
3. **Computable**: a problem is computable if an algorithm exists for solving it.
4. **Abstraction** allows us to view the problem and solution in such a way as to separate the so-called logical and physical perspectives.
5. **Programming** is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. 
6. **Data types** provide an interpretation for this binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense with respect to the problem being solved. 
7. An **abstract data type**, sometimes abbreviated **ADT**, is a <u>logical description</u> of <u>how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented</u>. 
8. The implementation of an abstract data type, often referred to as a **data structure**, will require that we provide a physical view of the data using some collection of programming constructs and primitive data types.
   - int char float double 这些是 数据类型 ，类比作原子，他们间的不同就是元素种类的不同，只涉及自身的不同，比如两种原子内的质子中子数不同，是一种内在属性。
   - 链表 队列 堆栈 树 这些是数据结构，类比作分子，他们间描述的是数据间的关系，就如同分子描述了原子的组合方式。
9. This is a **dynamic** **characteristic** of Python. The same variable can refer to many different types of data.
10. **Lists**, **strings**, and **tuples** are ordered collections that are very similar in general structure but have specific differences that must be understood for them to be used properly. **Sets** and **dictionaries** are unordered collections.
11. **Lists are mutable; strings are immutable**. For example, you can change an item in a list by using indexing and assignment. With a string that change is not allowed.
12. **Tuples** are very similar to lists in that they are **heterogeneous sequences of data**. The difference is that **<u>a tuple is immutable, like a string</u>**. A tuple cannot be changed. Tuples are written as comma-delimited values enclosed in parentheses. As sequences, they can use any operation described above.
